This lab demonstrates how to set up GitHub repositories, milestones, issues, projects, and project boards using Agile principles. Each step is **annotated** to help you understand the purpose behind the action.

---

## A: Create a GitHub Repo, Project, and Project Board

💡 **Purpose**: Establish the foundation for Agile planning and tracking by organizing work into milestones, issues, and visual project boards.

### Task 1: Create a GitHub Repo

1. Open a browser and go to [https://github.com](https://github.com).
2. **Login** using your GitHub account.
3. Click **Repositories > New** to start a new repository.
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Owner**: Your GitHub username.
   - **Repository name**: `DevOpsCoreIntroRepo`
   - **Visibility**: Set to `Private`.
   - **README**: Enable "Add a README file" ✅
   - **.gitignore**: Choose `Visual Studio` ➡️ *ignores typical build artifacts for .NET projects.*
   - **License**: Select `MIT` ➡️ *a permissive open-source license.*
5. Click **Create repository**.

> 🛠️ **Why this matters**: A well-initialized repo with a README, .gitignore, and license prepares your project for tracking and collaboration from day one.

---

### Task 2: Create GitHub Milestones and Issues

> 🧭 **Milestones help you track progress toward major objectives. Issues represent specific tasks or bugs.**

1. On the `DevOpsCoreIntroRepo` page, select the **Issues** tab.

   - **Title**: `alpha release`
   - **Due date**: One week from today
   - **Description**: "Completion of the alpha release"
   - Click **Create milestone**
3. Repeat to create `beta release` (due in 2 weeks, description: "Completion of the beta release")
4. Return to **Issues > New issue**
   - **Title**: `Repo README page is empty`
   - **Description**: "Brevity might be a virtue, but this README page can really use some text."
   - Set **Milestone**: `alpha release`
   - Set **Label**: `bug`
   - Click **Create**

> 📌 **Note**: Milestones let you visually monitor how close you are to a release. Labels categorize and filter issues.

---

## Task 1: Fork a GitHub Repo

> 🔍 **Explanation**: A *fork* is your own copy of someone else's repository. It lets you make changes without affecting the original project — useful for collaboration, experimentation, or contributions.

1. Navigate to [https://github.com](https://github.com).
2. Log in to your GitHub account.
3. Open the [Spoon-Knife repo](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) in a new tab.
4. Click **Fork** on the repo page.
5. On the "Create a new fork" screen:
   - Ensure **Owner** is your username.
   - Keep default name: `Spoon-Knife`.
   - Check “Copy the main branch only”.
   - Click **Create fork**.

> ✅ This gives you an isolated, editable copy of the upstream project.

---

## Task 2: Configure the GitHub Repo

> ⚙️ **Explanation**: Configuration enables GitHub features like **Issues** and **Pages**, and links your fork to project boards — allowing agile planning and live previewing of HTML content.

1. Go to your forked repo > **Settings**.
2. Under **General**, confirm default branch is `main`.
3. Enable **Issues**.
4. In the sidebar under **Code and automation**, click **Pages**.
5. Set branch to `main`, click **Save**.
6. Click **Visit site** (may take a few mins to appear).
7. Back in your repo, go to **Projects** > **Link a project** > choose **DevOps Core Intro Project**.

> 🌐 Now your HTML repo is published and linked to agile tracking.

---

## Task 3: Create an Issue

> 🐞 **Explanation**: An issue logs a bug, enhancement, or task — it's a central way to track what needs to be done.

1. Go to **Issues** > **New issue**.
2. Title: `index.html looks rather austere`
3. Description: `index.html file can use a modern touch`
4. Assign to yourself.
5. Label: `enhancement`
6. Project: `DevOps Core Intro Project`
7. Click **Create**
8. Reopen the issue, set status: **In Progress**
9. Check DevOps Core Intro Project board — your issue should be in **In Progress** column.

---

## Task 4: Create a Branch

> 🌱 **Explanation**: Branches let you safely make changes without breaking your main (production) code.

1. Go to **Code** tab.
2. Click the branch dropdown > create `update-index.html`
3. This becomes the **active working branch**.

---

## Task 5: Update Files in the Branch

> ✍️ **Explanation**: You're now updating HTML and CSS to improve the site's design.

1. Open `index.html` > click ✏️ edit icon.
2. Replace `<body>` (lines 12–17) with:

```html
<div id="octocat">
  <img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/NUX_Octodex.gif" alt="Octocat Image">
</div>

<p>
  Ready to team up? Let's collaborate, @octocat!
</p>
```

3. Click **Commit changes**, add note: `Modified image and paragraph text`.

4. Edit `styles.css`:
   - Replace content with:

```css
  color: #333;
  line-height: 1.5;
  text-align: center;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
}

#octocat img {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

5. Commit with message: `Modified CSS tags and selectors`

---

## Task 6: Create and Merge a Pull Request

> 🔁 **Explanation**: A pull request proposes your changes be merged into the `main` branch — a key step in team workflows.

1. Go to your fork, ensure branch = `update-index.html`
2. Click **Contribute > Open pull request**
3. Set base repo = your fork (not original `octocat/Spoon-Knife`)
4. Title: `Update index.html and styles.css`
5. Description: `Addressing #1`
6. Click **Create pull request**
7. Merge the pull request and click **Confirm merge**
8. Click **Delete branch**

---

## Task 7: Close the Issue

> ✔️ **Explanation**: Once your PR is merged, the issue can be closed. This updates the project board automatically if linked.

1. Go to **Issues**
2. Close `index.html looks rather austere`
3. Confirm issue now appears under **Done** in the project board

---

## Task 8: Validate the Changes

> 🔍 **Explanation**: Now you confirm that your site reflects the committed changes.

1. Go to **Settings > Pages** > click **Visit site**
2. Confirm new Octocat image and text are visible

> 🧪 You’ve now completed a full GitHub flow: fork → branch → edit → commit → pull request → merge → verify

## Task 1: Fork and review the GitHub repository

> 📦 **Goal**: Clone a pre-built repository that includes the .NET source, GitHub Actions workflow, and Bicep infrastructure-as-code templates.

1. Ensure you're signed in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the `eShopOnWeb` repository.
3. Click **Fork** and choose:
   - **Owner**: Your GitHub account
   - **Repo name**: `eShopOnWeb`
   - ✅ Leave **Copy the main branch only** checked
4. Confirm the repo was forked and the branch is `main`.

**🔍 Repo Structure Overview:**
- `.github/workflows/eshoponweb-cicd.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow
- `infra/webapp.bicep` – Azure Bicep deployment template
- `src/Web` – Web App source code

**💡 Key Concepts**:
- `buildandtest` job compiles and tests the code.
- `deploy` job provisions Azure infrastructure and deploys the app.
- `RESOURCE-GROUP` is an environment variable used in the workflow.
- A GitHub Secret is used to securely authenticate to Azure.

---

## Task 2: Configure the target environment

> 🧱 **Goal**: Set up Azure resources and secrets necessary for CI/CD to function.

### 🔧 Create Two Resource Groups

1. In Azure Portal → **Resource groups** → **+ Create**
2. First Group:
   - Name: `rg-eshoponweb-westeurope`
   - Region: `(Europe) West Europe`
3. Second Group:
   - Name: `rg-eshoponweb-eastus`
   - Region: `(US) East US`

### 🔐 Create a Service Principal

1. Open **Azure Cloud Shell** (Bash).
2. Store your subscription ID:

```bash
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
echo $SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

3. Create the service principal:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "devopsfoundationslabsp" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID --json-auth
```

> 📋 Save the JSON output (clientId, clientSecret, etc.).

### 🔑 Add GitHub Secret

1. Go to your forked GitHub repo → **Settings > Secrets > Actions**
2. Add a new secret:
   - Name: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
   - Value: Paste JSON from above

### 🌐 Generate Web App Names

```bash
echo devops-webapp-westeurope-$RANDOM$RANDOM
echo devops-webapp-eastus-$RANDOM$RANDOM
```

> 📋 Save the names. You’ll use them in the deployment step.

---

## Task 3: Validate the IaC and CI/CD functionality

> 🧪 **Goal**: Trigger GitHub Actions workflow to provision and deploy your app.

### 🛠 Modify Workflow for First Deployment

1. Go to `.github/workflows/eshoponweb-cicd.yml`
2. Click ✏️ Edit and update:

```yaml
on: workflow_dispatch
RESOURCE-GROUP: rg-eshoponweb-westeurope
subscriptionId: <your-subscription-id>
webappName: <first-generated-webapp-name>
```

3. Click **Commit changes**.

4. Open `infra/webapp.bicep` and update line 2:

```bicep
param sku string = 'S1' // The SKU of App Service Plan
```

5. Commit changes again.

### ▶️ Trigger GitHub Action

1. Navigate to **Actions > eShopOnWeb Build and Test**
2. Click **Run workflow > Branch: main > Run workflow**

Monitor the progress:
- First `buildandtest` job
- Then `deploy` job

> 💡 Re-run jobs if any step fails.

### 🔁 Modify for Second Deployment

Repeat workflow changes for:
- RESOURCE-GROUP: `rg-eshoponweb-eastus`
- webappName: second generated name

Then trigger workflow again and verify success.

---

## 🔍 Final Validation

1. In Azure Portal, search **App Services**.
2. Select each deployed app (`devops-webapp-*`) and click the domain.
3. Confirm the site loads and shows your deployed app.

> ✅ Leave resources running for the next lab.

Your team supports an online retail store experiencing intermittent regional outages. This lab configures Traffic Manager to distribute workloads and Chaos Studio to simulate failure scenarios.

### Tools
- **Azure Traffic Manager**: Global DNS-based load balancer
- **Azure Chaos Studio**: Fault injection to test app resilience

<details>
<summary>📁 Show Lab 04</summary>

## ⚙️ Exercise 0: Prepare the Azure Subscription for the Lab

> 🔍 **What this does**: Registers Azure Chaos Studio's provider in your subscription. This is needed before you can use Chaos Studio experiments.

...

## 🌐 Exercise 1: Enhance Workload Resiliency using Azure Traffic Manager

> 🎯 **Goal**: Use Azure Traffic Manager to route user traffic across two regions for high availability and fault tolerance.

### Task 1: Implement a Traffic Manager Profile
...

> 💡 **Explanation**: By setting priority-based routing, Azure will direct all traffic to East US unless that endpoint fails. TTL is reduced to 5s for faster failover.

...

### Task 2: Validate Traffic Manager Functionality
...

> 🔍 **Explanation**: Verifies if DNS failover is working by simulating failure and watching for region redirection.

...

## 💣 Exercise 2: Test Workload Resiliency using Azure Chaos Studio

> 🧠 **Goal**: Simulate service failure using Azure Chaos Studio and verify that Traffic Manager reroutes traffic properly.

### Task 1: Configure Chaos Studio Environment
...

> 💡 **Explanation**: Registers the app in East US as a Chaos Studio target. This sets up controlled failure testing.

...

### Task 2: Implement an Experiment
...

> 🎯 **Explanation**: Simulates downtime by stopping the web app in East US. The failover logic should push traffic to West Europe.

...

### Task 3: Validate the Experiment
...

> 🧪 **Explanation**: Ensures Chaos Studio stopped the East US app and Traffic Manager rerouted to West Europe.

...

## 🧹 Exercise 3: Clean Up Resources
